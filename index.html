            <h2>Hacker Manifesto</h2>
            <p><strong>"This is our world now… the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn’t run by profiteering gluttons. We explore… and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge… and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias… and you call us criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity."
        — The Hacker Manifesto (read by Dade Murphy aka Crash Override)</strong></p> 
            <p><em>"We are hackers. We hack. We’re not phreaks, or cyber terrorists, or whatever the media says. We are explorers, adventurers, and yes—sometimes pranksters. But we don’t destroy. We learn. We play. We grow."</em></p>
